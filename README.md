## Why "GitHub Pages Bootstrap"

#### Why I don't use "Octpress"?
Do you want to use Octpress? I'm not.

- Its directory structure is very confusing.

- If you want to generate and publish webpages automaticaly, you must write a script of travis CI with great difficulty.

Because I want to take the easy course, I use the Jekyll. But Octpress is ....

#### Why I don't use "Jekyll Bootstrap"?

- Do you know any people are using it?
- I want a "Template of Webpages theme".
- Modifying Webpages to look good is **very hard**.

So uncool.
